Work in progress

Back-End and Front-end meant to be deployed apart (I guess I have to use Docker Composer, althought I never used Docker).

Front-End is a react app.
use "npm start" to serve react app.

Back-end is a python algorithm and a micro-framework (bottle) to serve.
Use "python micro-server.py" to listen for requests on o localhost:8080

It´s not a good pratice to upload serviceAccountKey.json, but it´s not a sensitive project.
